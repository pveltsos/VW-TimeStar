# VW-TimeStar

TamperMonkey script to optimize time entryt for the timesheet from TimeStar by
- hiding the weekend rows
- hiding the previous days

TamperMonkey is required and available as a plug-in for most browswers via their respective extension stores.

Works only https://timestar.insperity.com/VWC/#-page=worksheet and does require a refresh after save as the code is client side ;)
